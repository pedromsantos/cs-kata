# C# kata starter

This project contains a number of katas with instructions ordered in a proven path described in my book [Agile Technical Practices Distilled](https://leanpub.com/agiletechnicalpracticesdistilled).

## Instructions

### Build solution

```sh
dotnet build
```

### Execute tests

```sh

Or use the TRX test reporting tool for enhanced console output:

```sh
dotnet test -l trx; trx
```

### Execute tests with coverage

```sh
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage;IncludeTestAssembly=true;Format=cobertura"
```

### Generate test coverage reports

```sh
reportgenerator -reports:"**/*coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:'CoverageReports' -reporttypes:'Html_Dark' -assemblyfilters:-AutoGeneratedProgram -classfilters:"-AutoGeneratedProgram;-*.*Should;-*.*Test*;-*.*TestDataGenerator"
```

### View coverage report

Open `CoverageReports/index.html` in your browser to view the detailed coverage report.
