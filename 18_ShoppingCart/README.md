# Shopping cart kata

## Goal

- Implement the shopping cart use cases for this company using a Domain Driven Design and Hexagonal architecture approach.
- Start from the use cases, we will not be implementing the transport layer for this project.
- Use a in-memory database implementation.

- Create a testing suite that can be confidently used to test your code.
  - Acceptance tests (Scenarios covering everything except repositories)
  - Unit Tests (Unit testing Entities, use cases, and domain services)
  - Integration tests (Testing the real repository implementation)
