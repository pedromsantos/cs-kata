# Yahtzee kata

## Rules

The game of yahtzee is a simple dice game.

Each round, each player rolls five six sided dice.
The player may choose to reroll some or all of the dice up to three times (including the original roll).

The player then places the roll at a category, such as ones, twos, sixes, pair, two pairs etc.
If the roll is compatible with the score, the player gets a score for this roll according to the rules.
If the roll is not compatible, the player gets a score of zero for this roll.

The kata consists of creating the rules to score rolls, calculate player totals and determine when game is finished.
