# Prime factors kata

Factorize a positive integer number into its prime factors.

For example:

| **Input** | **Output** |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 2         | `[2]`      |
| 3         | `[3]`      |
| 4         | `[2,2]`    |
| 6         | `[2,3]`    |
| 9         | `[3,3]`    |
| 12        | `[2,2,3]`  |
| 15        | `[3,5]`    |

## Folow TDD rules strictly

1. Write production code only to pass a failing unit test.
2. Write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail (compilation failures are failures).
3. Write no more production code than necessary to pass the one failing unit test.
