# Character Copier kata

## Problem

The character copier is a simple class that reads characters from a source and copies them to a destination one character at a time.

When the method Copy is called on the copier then it should read characters from the source and copy them to the destination until the source returns a newline (\n).

The exercise is to implement the character copier using Test Doubles for the source and the destination
Try using Spies – manually written Mocks – and Mocks written with a mocking framework.

Start from these definitions provided in kata.ts.

| **GetChar** | **SetChar** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 'a'         | 'a'         |
| 'b'         | 'b'         |
| '\n'        | NA          |
